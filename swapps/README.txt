Usage:
        - Just run the file (interface.php from the webserver) and the work is done

        Results:
                 - The results obtained are as a result from the request sent to the signed URL based on the
                    client parameters provided (lines {19 ,20} interface.php used by the server.

                 - The server arranges the output in a tabular form to show complete access of the objects
                   in a clearer fashion.
